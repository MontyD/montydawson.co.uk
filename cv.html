                <h3>Freelance</h3>
                <span class="role">Web Developer</span>
                <p>In order to further my skills and gain experience with new technologies I began to take on freelance projects for local organisations. I've developed a couple of small websites for local businesses - both built using the PHP CMS Silverstripe.
                    To gain as much as possible from these assignments I coded the themes from scratch - working to meet the client's brief whilst also ensuring clean and efficient code. Furthermore, I've taken on personal projects such as a real time
                    todolist webapp - written with Angular on the frontend and NodeJS on the backend. These projects have given me experience of working with APIs, databases (primarily Postgres), and ES6 - alongside frameworks such as Angular and Vue.</p>

                <h3>The Well Coffeeshop</h3>
                <span class="role">Volunteer Barista</span>
                <p>This monthly volunteer role has given me the great opportunity to learn how to use a professional espresso machine, as well meet and have a chat with people from the local community. It’s a very fun and rewarding way to spend one Saturday
                    each month.</p>

                <h3>Victoria Forms</h3>
                <span class="role">Consultant</span>
                <p>Victoria Forms is one of the leading providers of web forms for Local Government and large businesses. My time at Victoria Forms has allowed me to further my development skills, grow my confidence, and gain experience of working with customers
                    in a web development environment. I quickly gained experience of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, eventually being tasked with managing the redevelopment of the majority of our customers' front end design. I gained experience of working
                    with backend technologies as well - writing a custom webapp that automated key processes, setting up a number of 3rd party applications on Linux and Windows cloud servers, and helping to maintain the architecture of our main product.</p>
                <p>In my role as a general consultant I was the lead contact for key customers, and successfully lead the setup of solutions for new customers and significant redevelopment projects for our existing customers. I was tasked with managing entire
                    projects on my own, offering ongoing support to the customer, managing time frames, providing and off-site training. Furthermore I was often required to work as part of a team - helping to organise a joint effort to meet the customer's needs.</p>

                <span class="role">Temporary Admin</span>
                <p>This temporary role allowed me to gain experience of working in a professional office environment. I was tasked with typing up architectural reports, answering calls, proof-reading and providing ad-hoc administrative support. This role
                    certainly helped me develop a keen eye for detail and an enjoyment of working within a small team – attributes that I was able to apply in my later work.</p>

                <h3>The Big Issue London</h3>
                <span class="role">Street Team Volunteer</span>
                <p>This role involved training and supporting Big Issue sellers as they started to sell the Big Issue magazine on the streets of London. I was tasked with leading training sessions, and carrying out on-street visits to ensure that sellers
                    were happy and safe in their environment. This was a very challenging role but helped me learn a lot about the problems of homelessness and the state of life in London for the disadvantaged. </p>

                <span class="role">Student - BA (Hons) History First Class</span>
                <p>The two most important lessons I learnt from my degree were how to process information effectively, and how to communicate myself efficiently. I quickly learnt the importance of picking out the key information whilst researching, and how
                    to then take this information and use it to make a succinct and successful argument. These skills have been vital in my work life and have allowed me to learn new skills very quickly and communicate efficiently with clients and team
                    members. I am very proud of the work that I produced during my degree and and am grateful for the opportunity it gave me to live and study in London.</p>

                <p>I gained three A Levels – History (A), Music (B), English (B) – and an AS level in Photography (A). Previous to this I achieved nine GCSEs, seven of which were A grade (including Maths and English), and two at B grade. It feels pretty
                    stupid to be putting my GCSE results on here, but then you are reading them...</p>
